Guardrails are tools that help ensure the safe and reliable output of AI systems, preventing
LLMs and other generative models from generating responses that may be harmful or unwanted.

By their very nature, LLMs are **probabilistic models** that create outputs based on patterns learned
from vast amounts of training data, often **scraped from the internet**. Since the data they were 
trained on is rarely filtered or curated in any way, their responses can sometimes be
unpredictable or **unaligned with user or developer expectations**. On top of that, having become 
aware of the limitations of LLMs, users will sometimes try to **trick them** into generating harmful 
content through prompt injection or other adversarial techniques.

## How guardrails work

At their core, guardrails are **binary classification models** that are trained to analyze input and 
outputs of AI systems and, based on a set of rules and safety standards provided by the developer, 
determine whether they are ***safe*** or ***unsafe***.

They can be implemented as either
<Link href={Config.TASK_SPECIFIC_LLMS_POST}>task-specific LLMs</Link> specifically trained for 
the purpose of acting as guardrails, or through general-purpose LLMs that are prompted to behave
as guardrails. Performance-wise, task-specific LLMs are generally to be preferred, as they can be
fine-tuned and optimized for the specific domain and requirements of the application, while 
general-purpose LLMs can only be guided through prompt engineering.

While some kind of minimal guardrails should be included directly into the AI model's system 
prompt, so to set the tone and boundaries of the interaction and filter out obviously harmful
content, it is crucial that more stringent guardrails be implemented as **separate components**. 
This is because anything that is part of the model's prompt can be bypassed by a savvy user, while
separate components that the user has no direct access to are much **harder to trick**.

## Types of guardrails

Guardrails can be broadly grouped into two categories: **pre-inference** and **post-inference**.

**Pre-inference guardrails** are applied *before* the AI model generates a response, and are
typically used to ensure the user's input is appropriate. While the definition of *inappropriate
input* depends on the rules provided to the guardrail, examples of inappropriate inputs include
attempts to modify the behavior of the AI model or the guardrail itself (prompt injection), or 
requests for the generation of harmful or out-of-scope content.

**Post-inference guardrails**, on the other hand, are applied on the AI model's output, and are
used to ensure that the generated content is safe and appropriate, based on the provided rules
and safety standards. A classic example of post-inference guardrail is a safety filter that
flags content that holds sensitive data or out-of-scope information.

## Creating a guardrail model

While many developers resort to LLM APIs to implement guardrails, we believe that this is often not
the best approach. <Link href={Config.OFFLINE_NLP_POST}>Offline, local NLP solutions</Link> provide
a more cost-effective, private and customizable alternative to API-based guardrails, especially
when the volume of text to be processed is high.

At Tanaos, we developed <a href={Config.ARTIFEX_GITHUB_URL} rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>Artifex</a>,
an open-source Python library that allows you to create your own 
<Link href={Config.TASK_SPECIFIC_LLMS_POST}>task-specific NLP models</Link> that can be run offline on
your local machine. Artifex allows you to create guardrail models **without the need for any training data**.
You simply describe what rules the model should follow, and it will generate a guardrail model
for that purpose. The guardrails created with Artifex are so lightweight that they can **run locally or on small 
servers without a GPU**, offloading simple tasks and reducing reliance on third-party LLM APIs.

Artifex is free and open-source. Check it out on GitHub!
