The field of Natural Language Processing mostly consists of **two broad categories** of tasks: text **generation** and 
text **understanding/processing**. Computation-heavy tasks that cannot realistically be performed without resorting to 
LLMs hosted in the cloud are mostly limited to the first category, that is text generation. The large majority of 
tasks belonging to the second category, such as text classification, entity recognition, 
<Link href={Config.GUARDRAIL_MODELS_POST}>guardrailing</Link>, etc. are **simple enough to be performed offline** 
on a local device, without needing an internet connection.

We are so used to the idea of performing any kind of NLP task through cloud-based APIs (OpenAI's, Google's...) that 
we often employ them even when offline alternatives would make more sense. In fact, offline NLP offers **several
advantages** over its API-based counterpart.

## ðŸ’µ Cost-effectiveness

Even though the per-token cost of AI APIs might seem low, pricing can quickly become an issue at scale. As the number
of requests increases, so does the overall cost, which can hit the **tens of thousands of dollars per month** for 
businesses with medium to high volumes of text to processed.

Offline NLP solutions, on the other hand, involve **minimal to no recurring costs** after the initial setup, making
them a more cost-effective option for businesses with high-volume text processing needs.

## ðŸ”’ Privacy by Design

With cloud-based NLP, your data, including potentially sensitive information, is **sent to third-party servers** for
processing, and can be subsequently used for model training or other purposes, often **without your explicit consent**
or knowledge.

With local NLP, your **data never leaves your device**. Whether you are processing personal notes, customer conversations
or confidential documents, information is processed locally, ensuring that private data remains private.

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

API-based NLP solutions are designed to be **general-purpose** and cannot be easily tailored to specific use cases. This
can lead to suboptimal performances when dealing with <Link href={Config.TASK_SPECIFIC_LLMS_POST}>
    domain-specific applications or specialized vocabularies.</Link>.

Offline NLP solutions can be fine-tuned, pruned, quantized or even built from scratch to **meet business-specific
requirements**, avoiding the limitations of one-size-fits-all models and resulting in better performances.

## âš¡ Lower Latency

No round-trip to servers that are potentially located on the other side of the world means that offline NLP
solutions can offer **faster response times**. This is particularly important for applications that require real-time
processing, such as chatbots, virtual assistants or autocompletes, where even the slightest difference in speed
can **significantly impact user experience**.

## Create your own offline NLP model

At Tanaos, we developed <a href={Config.ARTIFEX_GITHUB_URL} rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>Artifex</a>, an open-source
Python library that allows you to create your own <Link href={Config.TASK_SPECIFIC_LLMS_POST}>task-specific NLP models</Link> that can be run offline on your local
machine, without needing any training data or GPUs. Try it out!
