src={financial_synthetic_data} \n            alt='Generate a synthetic financial transaction dataset with Tanaos' \n        />\n        <p>\n            In this case study, we will find out how to generate large amounts of synthetic financial data \n            with the Tanaos platform. First off, head \n            to <a href={Config.PLATFORM_BASE_URL} target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>platform.tanaos.com</a> and sign up for a free\n            account, if you don't have one already. Once you are logged in, you will be taken to the dashboard.\n        </p>\n        <img src={platform_dashboard} alt='Dashboard of the Tanaos Platform' className='img-with-shadow' />\n        <h3>Job Creation Wizard Step 1</h3>\n        <p>\n            Once you are on the dashboard, hit the <b>Create a new job</b> button, which will open the job creation wizard. The job\n            creation wizard is a 4-step guide that will help you create a new job. The first step is to select a <b>title</b> and,\n            optionally, a <b>subtitle</b> for your job. The title is a short description of the job, while the subtitle can be used to\n            provide additional context. The title and subtitle will be displayed next to the other job details on the dashboard \n            and have a purely informative purpose, as they are not used in the data generation process. In our case,\n            we will enter <i>Financial data test job</i> for Title, and <i>A sample job to generate financial data</i> for\n            Subtitle. Once you have entered a title and subtitle, click on the <b>Next</b> button to proceed to the next step.\n        </p>\n        <img \n            src={platform_job_wizard_step1} \n            alt='Step 1 of the Tanaos Platform synthetic data generation job creation wizard' \n            className='img-with-shadow' \n        />\n        <h3>Job Creation Wizard Step 2</h3>\n        <p>\n            Step number 2 of the job creation wizard is the <b>Output data description step</b>. Contrary to the title and subtitle\n            from step number one, which are not passed down to the generation model, the output data description is a <b>crucial \n            part of the job creation process</b> and has a large impact on the generated data. In the output data description\n            step, you should try to provide <b>as much context as possible</b> on the data you want to generate. This information will\n            be used by the generation model to decide how to generate the data. The description should include information such as \n            the domain of the data, the purpose it will be used for and any other relevant information that could help the model \n            generate the data you need. Information on the fields (or \"columns\") of the output dataset is not needed at this stage, \n            as it will provided in the next one. In our case, we will provide the following description:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <i>\n                \"Generate a bank statement-like financial transaction dataset, used by the account holder to track their\n                transactions and expenses.\"\n            </i>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once you have entered the output data description, click on the <b>Next</b> button to proceed to the next step.\n        </p>\n        <img \n            src={platform_job_wizard_step2} \n            alt='Step 2 of the Tanaos Platform synthetic data generation job creation wizard'\n            className='img-with-shadow'\n        />\n        <h3>Job Creation Wizard Step 3</h3>\n        <p>\n            Step number 3 of the job creation wizard is the <b>Output data structure</b> step. In this step, you will provide\n            information on the <b>structure of the output dataset</b>. This includes the names of the columns (or \"fields\") that you \n            want to have in the dataset, as well as their types. The column name should be short and descriptive of the data it will \n            contain. Our model is typically smart enough to <b>infer the kind of data</b> you want <b>from the column name</b>, without\n            needing to describe it explicitly. As we will see later, you will still be able to provide additional information on\n            the data at a later stage. The column type should be one of the following:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <b>Text:</b> A column that contains text data, such as a description, a name, a date, a location or an alphanumeric\n                ID.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>Integer Number:</b> A column that contains integer numbers, such as an amount, a quantity or a numeric ID.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>Decimal Number:</b> A column that contains decimal numbers (or \"floats\" in IT terminology), such as a price, a \n                rate or a weight.                \n            </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            In our case, we will go ahead and define the following columns:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <b>id (integer number): </b> A unique, numeric identifier for each transaction.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>amount (decimal number): </b> The amount of the transaction, expressed as a decimal number.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>description (text): </b> A short description of the transaction.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>date (text): </b> The date of the transaction, expressed as a string.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>category (text): </b> The category of the transaction, such as \"groceries\", \"entertainment\" or \"utilities\".\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>merchant (text): </b> The merchant or vendor associated with the transaction.\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            As usual, once you are done defining the columns, click on the <b>Next</b> button to proceed to the next (and last) \n            step.\n        </p>\n        <img \n            src={platform_job_wizard_step3} \n            alt='Step 3 of the Tanaos Platform synthetic data generation job creation wizard' \n            className='img-with-shadow'\n        />\n        <h3>Job Creation Wizard Step 4</h3>\n        <p>\n            The final step of the job creation wizard is the <b>Number of datapoints</b> step. As the name suggests, in this step\n            all you have to do is define the number of datapoints you want to generate. The number of datapoints is the number of \n            rows in the output dataset. The maximum number of datapoints you are allowed to generate on a single job depends on \n            your subscription plan. For more information on the available plans and the maximum number of datapoints per job associated\n            with each, please refer to the <a href={Config.WEBSITE_BASE_URL + '/pricing'} target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>pricing page</a>.\n            Since this is a test, we will go ahead and generate just <b>1.000 datapoints</b>. Once you have entered the\n            number of datapoints, click on the <b>Submit</b> button to create the job.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Job Refinement Chat</h3>\n        <p>\n            After you have triggered the job, you will be taken to the job refinement chat. The job refinement chat is a chat-like\n            interface that allows you to <b>interact with the model</b>, provide additional information on the data you want to \n            generate and in so doing <b>ensure that the output data is satisfactory</b> for you. After each message you send, the \n            model will respond with two pieces of information:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <b>Sample datapoints:</b> A few sample datapoints that the model has generated based on the information you have\n                provided up until that point, which reflects the model's current understanding of the job requirements. \n                The sample datapoints will help you understand whether the model is on the right track and assess the \n                quality and relevance of the data, before it is actually generated.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <b>Question:</b> A question that the model is asking you, in order to gather more information on the data you want\n                to generate. \n            </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            In much the same way as all modern chatbots, our model will keep asking you questions indefinitely and will \n            never terminate the conversation or pronounce itself \"satisfied\" with the amount of information it has. Each further \n            message you send will prompt the model to <b>modify its understanding of the data you want to generate</b> and generate \n            new sample datapoints. Once you feel that the sample datapoints are satisfactory and that the model has a good \n            understanding of the data you want to generate, you can trigger the data generation by clicking on \n            the <b>End chat and start job</b> button, and clicking on the <b>Yes, start the job</b> button in the confirmation\n            dialog that will appear.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Let's take a look at how the chat will play out in our case. The first message displayed in the chat will actually be\n            the job description you provided in the second step of the job creation wizard. The model will then ask us to provide\n            more information on the data we want to generate.\n        </p>\n        <img \n            src={platform_job_refinement_chat_first_message} \n            alt='Tanaos Platform - synthetic data generation job refinement chat'\n            className='img-with-shadow'\n        />\n        <p>\n            The sample data already looks quite good, but we can do even better. First off, those merchant names don't look very\n            realistic. Let's ask the model to ensure that they do, while also asking it not to use any real-world merchant names\n            in order to comply with privacy regulations or potential internal policies. We can do this by sending the following\n            message:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <i>\"The 'merchant' column should contain made-up but realistic merchant names\"</i>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Let's take a look at the sample datapoints the model has generated after this message.\n        </p>\n        <img \n            src={platform_job_refinement_chat_second_message} \n            alt='Tanaos Platform - synthetic data generation job refinement chat'\n            className='img-with-shadow'\n        />\n        <p>\n            The merchant names now look much better, don't they? We could now go on and ask the model to modify the \"date\" column\n            to include not only the day, month and year of the transaction, but also the time. Let's see what the model comes up with.\n        </p>\n        <img \n            src={platform_job_refinement_chat_third_message}\n            alt='Tanaos Platform - synthetic data generation job refinement chat'\n        />\n        <p>\n            That looks just about right. We could go on and ask the model to make sure all transaction amounts are less than 50, or\n            that the time be expressed in 12-hour format instead of 24-hour format, but for the sake of this example we will stop \n            here. Since we are now satisfied with the sample datapoints and the model's understanding of the data we want to \n            generate, we will now click on the <b>End chat and start job</b> button, and then on the <b>Yes, start the job</b> button\n            in the confirmation dialog that will appear. The model will now start generating the data, and a new entry will appear\n            in the list of jobs on the dashboard.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Output data</h3>\n        <p>\n            The job status will initially have a <b>In Progress</b> status, which means that the model is currently generating the\n            data. After a few seconds (or minutes, depending on the number of datapoints you requested), the status will change\n            to <b>Completed</b>, meaning that the data has been generated and is now available for download.
